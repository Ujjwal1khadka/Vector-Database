The Commission has been entrusted with the responsibilities of operating, supervising, directing and controlling the elections of the President, Vice-President, Federal Parliament, State Assembly and members of Local Level. Collecting voters’ list for the purpose of election and conducting referendum on the matters of national importance and registration and regulation of political parties are also within the purview of the Commission.\\n\\nElection\\n\\nCommission\\n\\nas\\n\\nThe Constitution has declared the country as a federal democratic republic and restructured it into Federal, State and Local levels. Structures like legislature, executive and judiciary or judicial committee have been provisioned for the operation of the State affairs from the local level. Periodic elections have been ensured accepting the supremacy of the adult franchise. The legislatures at all levels have been made more inclusive ensuring representation of various classes and communities of the country in the system of governance.\\n\\nThe image of the Commission remains high only if it could perform the responsibilities entrusted by the Constitution with full professional competence in a dignified manner as per expectation of citizens. For this, it is necessary for the Commission and its staff and those directly or indirectly engaged in election to have an updated knowledge on operation and management of elections. In this connection, this handbook has been prepared and published to make available the necessary information to the Commission and the staff thereof and individuals who are interested in the matters of elections, the formation of Election Commission, its functions, duties and powers of the Commission as envisaged by the Constitution; the\\n\\nelectoral systems adopted for various elections to be conducted by the Commission; the election of the President and Vice-President; formation of the Local level, State Assembly, the Federal Parliament; registration of political party and so on.\\n\\nI am fully confident that the present handbook prepared in question & answer format titled as ‘’Electoral Provisions in the Constitution of Nepal and Some Relevant Information’’ will be equally useful for the staff engaged in the Commission and offices thereunder, the voter’s education workers, political parties, voters, students, teachers, and other stakeholders.\\n\\nThe Commission always welcomes the verbal and written suggestions to be received from all stakeholders and well-wishers having interest on matter of elections in order to make the handbook more useful and informative. I would like to specially appreciate the efforts of Basudev Guragain, Joint Secretary and Deshbandhu Adhikari, Under Secretary of the Commission to bring this handbook in the present form.\\n\\nFinally, on behalf of Commission, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the officials of the Commission, secretary and all other employees of the Commission who are directly or indirectly involved in preparing this handbook.\\n\\nDr. Ayodhee Prasad Yadav\\n\\nApril, 2016\\n\\nChief Election Commissioner Election Commission, Nepal\\n\\nAcknowledgement\\n\\nThe Electoral Support Project is pleased to present English translation of ‘’Electoral Provisions in the Constitution of Nepal and Some Relevant Information’’ which was originally published in Nepali by the Election Commission of Nepal in April 2016. The Handbook in Nepali was well received by a wide range of Nepalese readers. It is because various electoral provisions reflected in the Constitution of Nepal (2015) were presented in question and answer form in simple and clear terms. Having received positive feedback from various stakeholders, the Election Commission now intends to publish it in other local languages for the benefit of people of Nepal.\\n\\nThis Handbook in English is published for the use of international community who are directly or indirectly involved in strengthening democratic governance in Nepal. This also could be an informative document for organizations and people outside Nepal for example, officials of Electoral Management Bodies, civic & voter educators, lawyers, academia, development partners and other electoral stakeholders at international level.\\n\\nFinally, on behalf of the Electoral Support Project, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Krishna Man Pradhan, Executive Director of Nepal Law Society, Navaraj Dhakal, Joint Secretary of the ECN, Kundan Das Shrestha, Deputy Project Manager and Mukunda Raj Pandeya, Training Specialist of UNDP Electoral Support Project for their contribution in translation/editing and Rochan Kadariya for designing of the Handbook.\\n\\nAndres del Castillo\\n\\nAugust, 2016\\n\\nChief Technical Advisor/Project Manager Electoral Support Project, UNDP Nepal\\n\\nACRONYMS\\n\\nAV\\n\\nBC\\n\\nAlternative Vote\\n\\nBV\\n\\nBorda Count\\n\\nFPTP\\n\\nBlock Vote\\n\\nList PR\\n\\nFirst Past the Post\\n\\nLV\\n\\nList Proportional Representation\\n\\nMMP\\n\\nLimited Vote\\n\\nPBV\\n\\nMixed Member Proportional\\n\\nPR\\n\\nParty Block Vote\\n\\nSNTV\\n\\nProportional Representation\\n\\nSTV\\n\\nSingle Non-Transferable Vote\\n\\nTRS\\n\\nSingle Transferable Vote\\n\\nTwo-Round System\\n\\nQUESTIONS-ANSWERS\\n\\n1. On which date was the Constitution of Nepal promulgated?\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Constitution of Nepal was promulgated on Sunday, the 20\\n\\nth\\n\\nof September, 2015 (Asoj 3, 2072). 2. What subjects concerning election have been dealt within the preamble to the Constitution?\\n\\n\\n\\nAdult franchise and periodic election have been categorically stated in the preamble to the Constitution.\\n\\n3. What is democracy?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe prevalence of supremacy of popular will in overall affairs of the state and operation of the State affairs based on peoples’ will is democracy.\\n\\nIn democracy, even the head of the state is directly or indirectly elected through popular will. Democracy has various forms. Representative democracy has been accepted all over the world.\\n\\n4. What is an election?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is not possible for all citizens to directly take part in the system of governance.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey are involved in the system of governance through their representatives who are elected through their secret ballot.\\n\\nThe rule and procedure of selection of representatives of peoples is election.\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is necessary to have a free, fair and credible election procedure and process.\\n\\n5. What is an electoral system?\\n\\nThe Electoral System Families\\n\\nPlurality/Majority\\n\\nMixed\\n\\nProportional Representation\\n\\nOther\\n\\nFPTP TRS AV BV PBV\\n\\nLIST PR\\n\\nSTV\\n\\nPARALLEL\\n\\nMMP\\n\\nSNTV\\n\\nLV\\n\\nBC\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe representatives of peoples are elected through their secret ballot based on adult franchise. It is necessary to convert the votes into seats. The rule of converting “votes into seats” is electoral system.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are altogether 12 electoral systems within the four major electoral system families namely: plurality/ majority, proportional representation, mixed and others.\\n\\nAll electoral systems have their own features. Because of the special features of each of these systems, there appear different results in the number of representation and its form even though the number of votes remain the same.\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn order to achieve peace, stability and prosperity and to address special circumstances of political change or specific issues recognized by the state most of the countries in the world have chosen new electoral system instead of the electoral system being used in the past.\\n\\nAfter the people’s movement of 2005/2006, we (Nepal) have opted for the mixed electoral system instead of the plurality/majority electoral system in order to manage the political conflict and to address the religious, cultural and social diversity of the country. The elections of the Constituent Assembly held in 2008 and 2013 were held adopting the mixed electoral system.\\n\\n6. What are the provisions in the Constitution on electoral system?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Constitution have provided various forms of electoral systems for the election of Local Level, State Assembly, Federal Parliament, President and Vice- President.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Constitution of Nepal has adopted the supremacy of the adult franchise and the principle of inclusive representation.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Constitution provisioned first past the post system for the election of Local Level, and the mixed electoral system of first past the post and proportional representation for the election of State Assembly and House of Representatives.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is provisioned that the President, Vice-President and members of the National Assembly are to be elected through an Electoral College.\\n\\nAt the Local Level, representatives are elected through\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\n\\nthe secret ballot based on the adult franchise. The elected representatives will elect office-bearers from among themselves. To ensure the representation of particular class or community, there are provisions to elect among candidates from those class or community only.\\n\\nProvisions of election through an Electoral College comprising of the representatives elected on the basis of adult franchise has been made for the election of the President, Vice-President and members of National Assembly and there is also a provision of nomination of members on the recommendations of the government for the National Assembly.\\n\\n7. What is understood by an Electoral College?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe group of persons elected through general voters for election of the President, Vice-President or other persons holding important position is called the Electoral College.\\n\\nIn case of Nepal, provisions have been made that the election of the President, Vice-President and members of the National Assembly would be held through the Electoral College.\\n\\n8. What is mixed electoral system?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe use of two different electoral systems at the same time is known as mixed electoral system.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis system has mixed the merits of plurality/ majority or other electoral systems and proportional representation electoral system.\\n\\nThe mixed family of electoral system comprises of two\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\n\\nsystems: mixed member proportional and parallel systems.\\n\\n\\n\\nNepal has adopted the parallel system.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the parallel system, the candidates are selected through plurality /majority and list-based proportional electoral systems. The results derived from both systems are not affected by each other.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn Nepal, the first past the post electoral system within plurality/majority electoral system and list-based proportional electoral system within the proportional electoral system are practiced.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe parallel system was used in the elections of the Constituent Assembly Members in Nepal.\\n\\nThe Constitution has adopted this system for the election of the House of Representatives and the State Assembly.\\n\\n9. What type of electoral system is the first past the post system?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is one of the systems of the plurality/majority electoral family.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is the oldest system amongst the electoral systems prevailing all over the world.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this system, the candidate who secures the highest valid votes will be elected.\\n\\n\\n\\nSingle member electoral constituency and candidate- centric ballot paper are used in this system.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this system, a voter casts one vote to one candidate.\\n\\nThe representatives will have accountability in terms\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\n\\nof geographical constituency. Popular candidates will be elected. It is more likely to form single party government. The opposition would be strong. These are the merits of this system.\\n\\nIt has some demerits as well. This system discourages the representation of fringe parties. There will be no balance between the votes secured and seats allocated. Votes go wasted. Sometimes minority may rule over majority. There will be no proportional representation. It does not ensure representation of women, marginalized and backward communities.\\n\\n10. What is the two-round electoral system?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is the electoral system where election could be held in two rounds. If no candidate or party could secure majority of the total votes in the first round of election then competition is held between the first and second candidates who secure the highest number of votes in the first round of election.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis system is used for the election of President in many countries.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Constitution of Nepal has adopted this system for the elections of the President and Vice-President.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince this system requires majority even in the second round. It is provisioned that after the second round, the candidate who secures highest vote out of the total votes cast is elected.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe voters will have opportunity to cast votes for two times in this electoral system.\\n\\nThis system increases the winning of popular party or candidate.\\n\\n6\\n\\n11. What is the proportional electoral system?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe system of allocation of seats on the basis of the votes secured by political parties is the proportional electoral system.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince multi-member electoral constituencies are mandatory for this electoral system, entire country is regarded to be one electoral constituency or constituencies are created based on State.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome of the countries have set minimum threshold required for representation.\\n\\n\\n\\nWithin proportional electoral system, there are two systems: List-based proportional and single transferable voting. Again, there are three types of lists: closed, open and free within list-based proportional system.\\n\\nIn the context of Nepal, the close list system within the proportional representation system has been adopted for the election of House of Representatives and State Assembly. 12. What is a closed-list?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPolitical parties submit the list of candidates to the election management body (the Election Commission in case of Nepal).\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce the final list is prepared, it can not be changed.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat is why it is called closed list.\\n\\n\\n\\nPolitical parries select the winning candidates based on the number of seats secured by them.\\n\\nThe formula such as Sainte-Laguë and modified Sainte- Laguë have been used to allocate seats to be obtained by political parties. In the election of the Constituent 7\\n\\nAssembly, the modified Sainte-Laguë formula was used (The method is to divide the votes by odd numbers 1.4, 3, 5, 7…… and so on and allocate the seat to the one with the highest remainder).\\n\\n13. What provision has been made in the Constitution with regard to formation of the Election Commission?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Election Commission is a Constitutional Body.
